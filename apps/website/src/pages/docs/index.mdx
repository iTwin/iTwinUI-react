## Getting Started

### Instalation

```shell
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```shell
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

### Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

### Theming

By default, all components use the light theme but we also provide support for switching to dark theme in two different ways:

- Use ThemeProvider in your root component where you can pass one of the following values:

  - light (default)
  - dark
  - os (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark' />
    // Your code goes here.
  </>
);
```

- The useTheme hook also provides the same functionality as ThemeProvider.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => {
  useTheme('dark');
  return <>/* Your code goes here.*/</>;
};
```

_Note: You only need to use one of these methods, and it only needs to be done once._

### Coding

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.
