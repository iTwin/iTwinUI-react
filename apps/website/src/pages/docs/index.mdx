## What is iTwinUI?

Over the course of three years, we’ve worked to distill most of the Bentley Systems web app interfaces into a set of UI components, forming the pattern library you see here. By documenting and assembling a reference site of our components and patterns, we were able to speed up our process and solve some internal communication problems. A common lexicon of code and UI elements benefits us in a few ways:

- We can build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items.
- We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel or roping in an engineer.
- We can see all of our patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.

Our pattern library is both a learning tool and a compass to correct our course as we build new things. We share our work here to help others on a similar path.

Just to be clear, this library isn’t meant to be a UI framework like Bootstrap—it’s not a definitive guide on how a web application should be built. It’s tailored specifically to our needs, so if you attempt to use it as a foundation for a future project your mileage may vary. Many of the ideas in our library are a greatest hits collection of ideas others have pioneered that we’ve adapted to meet our own challenges. Modify and mangle at will, but know this is not a supported system—it’s a living, learning library.

## Getting Started

### Instalation

```shell
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```shell
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

### Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

### Theming

By default, all components use the light theme but we also provide support for switching to dark theme in two different ways:

- Use ThemeProvider in your root component where you can pass one of the following values:

  - light (default)
  - dark
  - os (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark' />
    // Your code goes here.
  </>
);
```

- The useTheme hook also provides the same functionality as ThemeProvider.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => {
  useTheme('dark');
  return <>/* Your code goes here.*/</>;
};
```

_Note: You only need to use one of these methods, and it only needs to be done once._

### Coding

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.
