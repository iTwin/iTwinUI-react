## **Welcome to iTwinUI!**

### What is iTwinUI?

Over the course of three years, we’ve worked to distill most of the Bentley Systems web app interfaces into a set of UI components, forming the pattern library you see here. By documenting and assembling a reference site of our components and patterns, we were able to speed up our process and solve some internal communication problems. A common lexicon of code and UI elements benefits us in a few ways:

- We can build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items.
- We can reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel or roping in an engineer.
- We can see all of our patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.

Our pattern library is both a learning tool and a compass to correct our course as we build new things. We share our work here to help others on a similar path.

Just to be clear, this library isn’t meant to be a UI framework like Bootstrap—it’s not a definitive guide on how a web application should be built. It’s tailored specifically to our needs, so if you attempt to use it as a foundation for a future project your mileage may vary. Many of the ideas in our library are a greatest hits collection of ideas others have pioneered that we’ve adapted to meet our own challenges. Modify and mangle at will, but know this is not a supported system—it’s a living, learning library.

### Who’s maintaining iTwinUI?

iTwinUI at it’s core is HTML and the SCSS that styles it. The HTML & SCSS is actively maintained by the UX Front End team. The HTML and compiled CSS is then implemented into other projects as needed, such as the iTwinUI React project. The iTwinUI React project is currently maintained solely by volunteer developers. If you are interested in volunteering, please join us in our weekly Microsoft Team’s iTwinUI React channel meeting on Tuesday’s @ 9:30AM EST for at least 30 minutes.

### Site structure

Our documentation is grouped into a couple of different categories following Brad Frost’s Atomic Design guidelines:

### Resources

We try to provide any additional resources and assets to help both designers and developers. Below is a list of some of the things we often provide:

- HTML code snippets available within [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI).
- React code snippets available within [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI-react).
- Blazor code snippets available within [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI-blazor).
- Demo / Prototype using Axure or Adobe XD.
- Component library using Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, XD).
- Specifications using Zeplin.
  - Bentley Web Components
  - App UI - Light theme
  - App UI - Dark theme

Note that you may have to request access to view the Adobe Creative Cloud library and the Zeplin specifications. Please contact us to request access to the component library.

You can give feedback by contacting a member of the visual team. We want to supply the assets that are most helpful so feedback is welcomed. Visit the support page for the visual team’s contact information.

### Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.
